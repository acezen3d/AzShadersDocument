# Editor stub shaders

## Overview
Shaders in this directory are stubs of Az Standard shaders that can be used in Unity Editor for modding. You can download them and place them in your Unity project so that Az Standard shaders will appear in Unity's shader selection dropdown. This makes it easier for those who wish to use Az Standard shaders to create materials for their mods.\
Happy modding!

## Notes
- These shaders are not real, they are fake shaders that will be replaced with the real ones in the game by Material Editor. So you can adjust the properties based on the actual rendering results in the game.
- In Unity Editor, only `MainTex` takes effect, but all the properties, including keywords, will be correctly packed in mods and work properly in the game.
