# Changelog

## v1.0.0
- Add visualization option for World Tangent.
- Add support for displaying TBN vectors.
- Merge Tessellation and Displacement categories into Mesh category.
- Change the behavior of `TessSmoothMap` so that vertices generated by tessellation no longer rely on interpolation of the original vertex values, but are applied directly.
- Add `VertexNormalMap` and `VertexTangentMap` along with their corresponding control properties.

## v1.1.0
- Add `Mask`, `Cutoff` to provide the clipping mask for the lines and fills.
- Add `VectorsMask`, `VectorsCutoff` to provide the clipping mask for vectors display.

## v1.2.0
- The custom mesh normals derived from `VertexNormalMap` are no longer applied directly to the tessellation and displacement, but instead masked by `green` channel of `TessSmoothMap` and `DisplaceMap` to control the influence on each of them.
- Modify the default values of `TessSmoothMap`, `DisplaceMap` and `DisplaceMiddleLevel`.
- Fix minor issues with the unpacking and blending of the tangent map.
