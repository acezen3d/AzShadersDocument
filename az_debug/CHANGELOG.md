# Changelog

## v1.0.0
- Add visualization option for World Tangent.
- Add support for displaying TBN vectors.
- Merge Tessellation and Displacement categories into Mesh category.
- Change the behavior of `TessSmoothMap` so that vertices generated by tessellation no longer rely on interpolation of the original vertex values, but are applied directly.
- Add `VertexNormalMap` and `VertexTangentMap` along with their corresponding control properties.
