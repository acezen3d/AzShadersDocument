### DrawnMap
*Koikatsu property*. Koikatsu's original `DetailMask` can be assigned to this. `red`: drawn specular highlights, `green`: drawn shadows.

### DrawnSpecularStrength
*Koikatsu property*. The strength of the drawn specular highlights, the larger the brighter. Very limitedly similar to `SpecularPower` in Koikatsu built-in shaders.

### DrawnShadowStrength
*Koikatsu property*. The strength of the drawn shadows, the larger the darker. Very limitedly similar to `ShadowExtend` in Koikatsu built-in shaders.
